		<h1>New Light</h1>
		<p>by John Mayer</p>
		<p>
I'm the boy in your other phone </br>
Lighting up inside your drawer at home all alone</br>
Pushing 40 in the friend zone</br>
We talk and then you walk away every day</br>
Oh, you don't think twice 'bout me</br>
And maybe you're right to doubt me, but</br>
But if you give me just one night</br>
You're gonna see me in a new light</br>
Yeah, if you give me just one night</br>
To meet you underneath the moonlight</br>
Oh, I want a take two, I want to breakthrough</br>
I wanna know the real thing about you</br>
So I can see you in a new light</br>
Take a ride up to Malibu</br>
I just wanna stay to look at you, look at you</br>
What would it matter if your friends knew?</br>
Who cares what other people say anyway</br>
Oh, we can go far from the end</br>
And make a new world together baby</br>
'Cause if you give me just one night</br>
You're gonna see me in a new light</br>
Yeah, if you give me just one night</br>
To meet you underneath the moonlight</br>
Oh, I want a take two, I want to breakthrough</br>
</p>
